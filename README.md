# Decoding Space: Integrating Multiplexed Imaging and Deep Visual Proteomics  
**Material for the ASMS 2025 Bioinformatics Hub Workshop**  


## PIPEX & MxDVP Hands-On Workshop  
This hands-on workshop replicates key steps in analyzing multiplexed tissue images and transitioning to single-cell deep proteomics:  
- Segmenting tissue cells and annotating markers using PIPEX  
- Exporting data for MS-based proteomics analysis  
- Performing QC and in-depth single-cell proteomics  
- Discussing challenges and opportunities in spatial-MS workflows  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Before the session:** Please complete the steps below to avoid delays and connectivity issues during the workshop!
